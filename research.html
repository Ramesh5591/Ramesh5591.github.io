<h1>Research Statement</h1>

<p>
My research interests lie at the intersection of plant genomics,
computational biology, and artificial intelligence.
</p>

<p>
I aim to understand plant defense mechanisms and agronomical traits
by integrating genome-wide analyses,
and deep learning–based predictive models.
</p>

<p>
During my post-doctoral training, I seek to develop scalable
and interpretable AI models for plant stress biology.
